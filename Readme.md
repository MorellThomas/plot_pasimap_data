# Plotting script for PaSiMap data

This R script takes the coordinates from a PaSiMap analysis ([Su et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36212532/ "Pairwise sequence similarity mapping with PaSiMap: Reclassification of immunoglobulin domains from titin as case study")) as a csv file and creates interactive 2D and 3D scatterplots to visualise the data and aid in its analysis.

## Intended for use with Jalview

This script was originally created for the use together with the PaSiMap implementation in [Jalview](https://www.jalview.org).

**It is part of a publication describing the usage of PaSiMap in Jalview and the subsequent analysis using this R script ([Morell et al.](https://www.cell.com/star-protocols/home "Not yet published"))**

## Example Data

A set of example data is provided for both the PaSiMap analysis in Jalview and also the analysis using this script. 
Both can be found in _example_data_.
